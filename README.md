# Keccak-256-SHA-3-

# Description
Keccak-256 (SHA-3) is a specific instance of the Keccak cryptographic hash function, which was selected as the winner of the NIST hash function competition and subsequently standardized as SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3).

### Technical Details:
- State Size: Keccak operates on a state of 1600 bits, organized as a 5x5x64 matrix.
- Rate and Capacity: For Keccak-256, the rate (r) is 1088 bits and the capacity (c) is 512 bits. The rate determines how much of the input is absorbed into the state at each iteration, and the capacity provides security.
- Permutation Function: The core of Keccak is its permutation function, Keccak-f, which applies a series of bitwise operations to transform the state.


# Installation

```

# Usage
- Cryptocurrencies: Keccak-256 is widely used in blockchain and cryptocurrency applications, including Ethereum.
- Digital Signatures: Used in digital signature schemes to ensure the integrity and authenticity of messages.
- General Security: Utilized in various security protocols and systems that require secure hash functions.

## Features
1.	**Hash Length**: Produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value.
2.	**Security:** Designed to provide security against a wide range of attacks, including collision attacks, preimage attacks, and length extension attacks.
3.	**Sponge Construction:** Uses a sponge construction that allows the same algorithm to be used for hashing, pseudorandom number generation, and other cryptographic functions.

### Example Usage in Python:
```
from Crypto.Hash import keccak

def keccak256(data):
    k = keccak.new(digest_bits=256)
    k.update(data.encode('utf-8'))
    return k.hexdigest()

# Example
print(keccak256("Hello, world!"))  # Outputs the Keccak-256 hash of the input string
```
``
Output: 
    Input: Hello, world!
    Keccak-256 Hash: 644bcc7e564373040e3fd35074d0f9201bb59e4c661ad49d9d0e60734531e4dc
``
### Example Usage in Go:
``
go get golang.org/x/crypto/sha3
``

```
package main

import (
	"crypto/sha3"
	"encoding/hex"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func keccak256(input string) string {
	hash := sha3.New256()
	hash.Write([]byte(input))
	return hex.EncodeToString(hash.Sum(nil))
}

func main() {
	if len(os.Args) < 2 {
		fmt.Println("Usage: go run keccak256_client.go <input_string>")
		return
	}

	input := os.Args[1]
	hashOutput := keccak256(input)

	fmt.Printf("Input: %s\n", input)
	fmt.Printf("Keccak-256 Hash: %s\n", hashOutput)
}
```
